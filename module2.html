        <h2>Before You Start</h2>
        <p> A good understanding of LaTeX comes from appreciating both the problem it is solving and
		the kind of solution it provides.		
        </p>
        <p> 
        <ol>
   		<li> Reflect on some of the symbols and notation that you use when writing mathematics: greek letters,
		exponents, subscripts, radical signs... can you think of some others?</li>
		<li> Have you used or read about languages used in computer programming? LaTeX is sometimes 
		described as a <strong>descriptive markup language</strong>. Take a moment to look at the Wikipedia
		entry on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language">markup languages</a>. </li>
       </ol>
		</p>
		<p> As you work through this module, you can use the  <a href = "./simpleLaTex.html">Simple Renderer</a> to test commands, and when
		you feel like assessing how much you have learned, try the <a href="./quiz.htm"l>Command Quiz</a>.  
		</p>
   		<p> For each new command you learn, consider building the document that you started as an exercise in module 1: </p>
   		<div style="padding:4px;border:thin solid black;">
		<p><strong>Exercise:</strong> Create a document in a word processor and record each of the LaTeX commands that
		you have tried. Alongside each command, include an image of the math that the command creates from one of the editors
		you used in this module.</p>

        <h2>Essential Commands</h2>
       <p> In this document, we will describe commands assuming that you are using them within LaTeX's <strong>math mode</strong>.
       If you are writing an entire LaTeX document, you need to mark the beginning and end of this mode within your document. In 
       many online environemnts and simple equation editors, you do not need to do this.  Additional details on marking
	   math mode are provided in later modules. LaTeX features two modes for displaying math, <strong>inline</strong> for when 
	   you use math notation directly in a paragraph, and <strong>displayed equation</strong> mode, where the math is separated
	   from the text (similar to inline quotations and block quotes). These distinctions
	   are not important for this module, but will be touched on later.
       <h3> Two Important Characters </h3>
       <p>
       Because LaTeX is included directly in documents, there has to be some way to tell the difference between LaTeX commands and
       normal words within the document. This is what the <strong>backslash</strong> (\) accomplishes - most LaTeX commands are prefixed
	   by the backslahs, which functions as an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_character">escape character</a>. If you ever need to
	   type an actual backslash within a LaTeX document, you must type a double backslash (\\).
	   <\p>
	   <p> Not all math commands require a backslash. Exponents are created using the carrot (^) and subscripts are created using the underscore(_)
	   without being prefixed by a backslash. <\p>
	   <p> The following snippet shows the use of underscore, carrots and a command requiring backslash (\theta).
<div class="dm-code">
<pre>

    x_0 = \theta^2

</pre> 
</div>

	   Which is rendered by LaTeX as:
	   \[ \large{x_0 = \theta^2} \]	   
	   </p>
	   <p> The other special character(s) that you need to be aware of are the <strong>curly braces</strong> ({}). These are used to 
	   block off a set of latex commands that need to be considered as one unit, or if values need to be provided to
	   be included as part of another command. If you need to include curly braces as part of the displayed math, you 
	   must prefix them with a backslash.
		</p>
	   <p> The following snippet shows the use of curly braces to create an exponent with more than one symbol.

<div class="dm-code">
<pre>

    e^{i\theta} = \cos(\theta) + i\sin(\theta)

</pre> 
</div>

	   Which is rendered by LaTeX as:
	   \[ \large{e^{i\theta} = \cos(\theta) + i\sin(\theta)} \]	   
	   </p>
	   <p> This next example shows how to include curly braces in the displayed math.
<div class="dm-code">
<pre>

    \{\theta \in \textbf{R} | -\pi \leq \theta \leq \pi \}

</pre> 
</div>

	   Which is rendered by LaTeX as:
	   \[ \large{\{\theta \in \textbf{R} | -\pi \leq \theta \leq \pi \}} \]	   
	   </p>
	   
	<h3> Finding the Right Command </h3>
		<p> The above examples used many commands, like <strong>\theta</strong>, <strong>\pi</strong>, <strong>\leq</strong>, and others. There are commands 
		for virtually every symbol and notation that you might need - some of them are obvious,
		as is the case for the greek letters, and some are memorable, like <strong>\leq</strong> for "less than or equal to."
		Generally, you will need to look up commands using a reference. A <a href="https://oeis.org/wiki/List_of_LaTeX_mathematical_symbols">good listing</a> is available
		at the <a href="https://oeis.org/">Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS)</a> - an interesting site to check out, if
		you have the time.
		</p>
		<p> Some commands, like <strong>\cos</strong> and <strong>\sin</strong> do not seem to do much - but they do let LaTeX know 
		that cos and sin are not just words, but functions - this causes them to be rendered not italicised,
		whereas any word or letter without a backslash will be put in italics inside an equation (like the
		variable x in the examples). In this way, LaTeX is helping to ensure that standard mathematical
		communication practices are followed. The <strong>\textbf</strong> is another example of how we can 
		follow mathematical conventions by bolding the letter that represents the set of real numbers.
    
	<h3> Fractions </h3>
	<p>Fractions are difficult to write without the help of something like LaTeX, and also provide
	a good example of a command that takes arguments or parameters. In this case, to write a fraction,
	we need to provide two values, the numerator and the denominator. We do this in LaTeX like this:
<div class="dm-code">
<pre>

    \frac{9}{10}

</pre> 
</div>

	   Which is rendered as:
	   \[ \large{\frac{9}{10}} \]	   
	   </p>
	
	<p>
	The two sets of curly braces are required here to supply values for the numerator and the denominator.
	Of course, we sometimes need to include fractions in more complicated expressions, like this one,
	which shows the formula for a binomial coefficient:
<div class="dm-code">
<pre>

    \binom{n}{r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}

</pre> 
</div>

	   Which is rendered by LaTeX as: <br>
	   \[ \large{\binom{n}{r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}} \]	   
	   </p>	
	<p>
	More involved fractions, and continued fractions, are supported by the <strong>\cfrac</strong>
	command, whose use provides a good example of nesting commands. For example,

<div class="dm-code">
<pre>

	a_0 + \cfrac{1}{a_1 + \cfrac{1}{a_2+\cfrac{1}{a_3}}}	
	
</pre> 
</div>

	   is rendered by LaTeX as: <br>
	   \[ \large{a_0 + \cfrac{1}{a_1 + \cfrac{1}{a_2+\cfrac{1}{a_3}}}} \]	   
	   </p>	
	<br>
	<h3> Radicals </h3>
	<p> Some LaTeX commands require special parameters that are identified using square
	brackets. The radical sign is one of these. When used on its own, it is the convential
	square root<\p>
<div class="dm-code">
<pre>

	y = \sqrt{x}	
	
</pre> 
</div>

	   which displays as: <br>
	   \[ \large{y = \sqrt{x}} \]	   
	   </p>	
	<br>
	
	When a value is provided using square brackets, we can obtain other roots, for example:
<div class="dm-code">
<pre>

	\sqrt[n]{x} = x^{\frac{1}{n}}	
	
</pre> 
</div>

	   which displays as: <br>
	   \[ \large{\sqrt[n]{x} = x^{\frac{1}{n}}	} \]	   
	   </p>	
	<br>	
	<h3> Some More Advanced Notation </h3>
	
	<p>
	To format something like a matrix, we need
	some way of creating a table structure, and some way of creating
	large square brackets to surround the table.

	The need to create Tables in LaTeX occurs in several settings, and matrix
	mode provides a good example of how they are created. There are several 
	more advanced formatting situations that require a special mode. These
	modes are indicated by the <strong>\begin</strong> and <strong>\end</strong> 
	commands, which take the name of the mode as an argument. In matrix mode, ampersands (&)
	are used to denote columns or tab-alignments, while the double backslash (\\) is 
	used to denote the end of a row. A matrix then, is created like this:
	
<div class="dm-code">
<pre>   

 	\left[\begin{matrix}
  	a & b & c \\
 	d & e & f \\
  	g & h & i
 	\end{matrix}\right]

</pre> 
</div>

	   Which is rendered by LaTeX as: <br>
	   \[ \large{
 \left[\begin{matrix}
  a & b & c \\
  d & e & f \\
  g & h & i
 \end{matrix}\right]} \]	   
	   </p>	
	<p> The <strong>\left</strong> and <strong>\right</strong> commands are used in front of
	a bracket to signal that they should be adjusted to enclose the notation between them.
	</p>
	A similar structure (the <strong>align</strong> mode) is used to get the correct alignment in multi-line equations. 
	For example:

<div class="dm-code">
<pre> 

	\begin{align}
	\Delta x & = x_2 - x_1 \\
 	& = 9-2 \\
	& =7 
	\end{align}

</pre> 
</div>
	Which is rendered by LaTeX as: <br>
	\[ \large{\begin{align}
	\Delta x & = x_2 - x_1 \\
	& = 9-2 \\
	& =7 
	\end{align}} \]	   

	<p> A good overview of more advanced math formatting is provided by the 
	<a href= "https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics">LaTeX Wikibook</a>.
