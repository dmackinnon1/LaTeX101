# LaTeX101

A digital learning resource for high school mathematics teachers.

There are a few ways in which this resource differes from most available treatments of LaTeX.
1. The focus is on high school mathematics teachers, rather than researchers or grad students.

2. It is presented as an online course, rather than as a slide deck or document. It has some interactive elements, quizzes, and exercises. It could be used a hands-on workshop.

3. It does not focus on document preparation (although there is a section on this), but mostly on learning LaTeX commands that can be used on a variety of platforms (Brightspace, Geogebra, etc.). 

The assumption is that high school math teachers are increasingly using digital platforms for communicating mathematics. Many of these platforms are integrating partial LaTeX support as a solution for displaying math notation and symbols. For platforms that lack this support, there are stand-alone LaTeX equation editors that can be used to generate images that can be imported.

## Running as an In-Person Workshop
Although intended to function as a self-directed learning resource, the LaTeX101 digital learning resource can be used as an in-person hands on workshop. In this context, having participants work on and potentially share their "cheetsheet" from Exercise 1 throughout, would be a way to tie the course together.

In an in-person workshop, a possible flow would be to allow participants to go ahead and work through the material of each module, pausing to consolidate after around 15 minutes for each. This would break the workshop up into two sections of about 45 minutes each.

## Utilities
In addition to the learning modules, the learning resource includes a [simple LaTeX renderer](https://dmackinnon1.github.io/LaTeX101/simpleLaTeX.html) and a [LaTeX Command Quiz](https://dmackinnon1.github.io/LaTeX101/quiz.html)
