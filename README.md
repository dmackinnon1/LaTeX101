# LaTeX101

A digital learning resource for high school mathematics teachers.

There are a few ways in which this resource differes from most available treatments of LaTeX.
1. The focus is on high school mathematics teachers, rather than researchers or grad students.

2. It is presented as an online course, rather than as a slide deck or document. It has some interactive elements, quizzes, and exercises. It could be used a hands-on workshop.

3. It does not focus on document preparation (although there is a section on this), but mostly on learning LaTeX commands that can be used on a variety of platforms (Brightspace, Geogebra, etc.). 

The assumption is that high school math teachers are increasingly using digital platforms for communicating mathematics. Many of these platforms are integrating partial LaTeX support as a solution for displaying math notation and symbols. For platforms that lack this support, there are stand-alone LaTeX equation editors that can be used to generate images that can be imported.
