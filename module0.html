                  <h2>Before You Start</h2>
                  <p>Before learning about what LaTeX is, spend a few minutes thinking about 
                  the problem of writing mathematics for digital documents. How do you do this
                  today? Do you avoid using word-processors when creating resources and 
                  assessments because it is hard to include mathematical notation and get 
                  the formatting right? Do you use equation editors, or hand-write the 
                  mathematics and paste it in when photocopying? Teachers use many strategies to overcome the difficulties of communicating mathematics in digital environments. </p>
                  <p> Consider these questions:
                  <ol>
                     <li> What makes writing mathematics in digital documents difficult? </li>
                     <li> How do you avoid those problems, or solve them, when you teach a math class? </li>
                  </ol>
                  <p> At a minimum, LaTeX can be another arrow in your quiver of 
                     mathematical communication strategies. Depending on 
                     how you apply it and what kind of documents you create and 
                     platforms you use, you may find that knowing a little 
                     LaTeX can be a great benefit - improving the quality of your 
                     communication and expanding the number of new platforms you can use in your teaching.

                  <h2>Introducing LaTeX</h2>
                  <p>
                     One way to think about LaTeX is as a programming language 
                     for writing mathematics. 
                     You type in commands, and the LaTeX processor
                     converts it into the kind of math notation that we expect to see in printed documents.
                     For example, you type:
                  <div class="dm-code">
<pre>

    \frac{x^2-2x+1}{x-1}

</pre>
                  </div>
                  And LaTeX will generate:
                  \[ \frac{x^2-2x+1}{x-1} \]     
                  </p>
                  <p> As you may notice from the example above, writing LaTeX involves 
                     a combination some standard 
                     conventions for writing digital mathematics, 
                     like using the carrot (^) symbol 
                     for exponents, 
                     regular text, 
                     and some special commands like 
                     the "\frac{}{}" to create a fraction.
                  </p>
                  <p> In the modules that follow this one, you'll learn some of the conventions 
                     and commands used 
                     in LaTeX, and also how to use LaTeX 
                     on various platforms. One example of LaTeX use are web-pages like the one you
                     are reading now, where the formulas shown are rendered using 
                     LaTeX by integrating a special
                     JavaScript library called <strong>MathJaX</strong>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     The most powerful and widely used system for creating equations and 
                     mathematical documents is not a new technology. The TeX formatting system was 
                     originally created by Donald Knuth in 1978, and an easier to use software layer, 
                     LaTex, was added to TeX by Leslie Lamport in 1980. 
                     By web-standards, this is old technology: 
                     it has been used by mathematicians and scientists around the world for decades, 
                     and is very widely used today (LaTeX. 2019).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     So what is new? There are two relatively new developments that make it 
                     very useful for math teachers to learn how to use LaTeX:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>
                        In recent years many platforms have adopted LaTeX as the means by which they 
                        display equations. Knowing the basics of LaTeX commands will allow you to quickly 
                        add equations in a consistent way to wikis, webpages, platforms like 
                        <strong>Brightspace</strong>, <strong>Google Docs</strong>, and programs 
                        like <strong>GeoGebra</strong>. We will take a look at some of these in module 3.
                     </li>
                     <br/>
                     <li>
                        Running a complete LaTeX processor on your own computer used to require some 
                        technical skill and a willingness to muck around with installing components and 
                        adjusting configuration - the setup was not always straightforward. Now there are 
                        cloud-based LaTeX offerings (like <strong>Overleaf</strong>) which make it 
                        easier to produce complete LaTex documents. We will take a look at a cloud-based LaTeX
                        environment in module 4.
                     </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                     LaTeX, and TeX the system it is based on, are computer languages, not applications 
                     or plugins. Although software is required to render anything written in these 
                     languages into nice mathematics (just like your browser is required to render HTML), 
                     you don’t need any special software to write LaTeX (Notepad, Sublime, vi, or any text 
                     editor will do).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     LaTeX resembles HTML or Markdown in how it allows a plain text document to be 
                     enhanced with formatting instructions. 
                
                     When an entire document is created using LaTeX, a simple text file is created that 
                     has some commands that
                     instruct the LaTeX processor. 
                  </p>
                  <div class="dm-code">

                     Donald Knuth, the creator of TeX upon which LaTeX is based, is a prolific mathematician and computer scientist who has made many
                     interesting contributions to both disciplines. Leslie Lamport, who built upon TeX to create LaTeX, is an award winning computer science
                     pioneer. Take a moment to read their online biographies and learn about what motivated them to tackle the challenge of 
                     typesetting digital mathematics.
